# An Analysis of GPA, MAP Scores, and Engagement for English Learners
## Winter 2018
## Kathleen Coughlin

## Objective
Determine how student GPA relates to performance on the MAP standardized assessment. 

## GPA & Test Score Connection
- In theory, test scores and grades are both meant to measure the same thing: student knowledge and mastery of specific skills
- If a student earns a lower test score, they should be earning lower grades
- As GPA increases along the bottom of the graph, MAP scores should increase vertically as well
- Is that happening?

## GPA 
- For analysis, combined into "humanities" GPA (ELA & History) and "STEM" GPA (Math & Science)
- Average the grade points for the two classes
- From the student handbook:

| Letter Grade | Percentage | Grade Point |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| A | 90-100 | 4.0 |
| B+ | 87-89 | 3.5 |
| B | 80-86 | 3.0 |
| C+ | 77-79 | 2.5 |
| C | 70-76 | 2.0 |
| F | 0-69 | 0 |

## The Assessment: MAP
- Taken 3 times per year: Fall, Winter, Spring
- An adaptive assessment
   - Answer questions correctly and the test gives harder questions 
   - Answer questions incorrectly and the test gives easier questions
   - This continues until the student’s proficiency level is determined
- Separate scaled scores on the ELA and Math portions of the assessment
- Meant to be a predictor of performance on the PARCC assessment in May

## The Challenge: Disengagement
- When the MAP system detects disengagement (i.e., rapid guessing), it halts the adaptability feature of the test
- Without the test adapting question difficulty, the system cannot accurately gauge a student’s proficiency level
- High levels of disengagement undermine test validity

## Effects of Disengagement
- Overall, there is a moderate correlation between Q2 GPA and Winter MAP scores, with a stronger relationship for the ELA section
- For students who were flagged as disengaged, the correlation was noticeably weaker between GPA and MAP scores
- This effect was observed on both the ELA and math tests but was stronger on math

# Grade-Level Focus: Guiding Question
When looking at the grade-level charts consider the following questions:
- What trends do you notice for each grade?
- Are there interesting outliers?
- What similarities or differences do you notice across grades?

*see the R file for charts*

## PARCC Connection
- MAP is meant to predict student performance on PARCC
- By spring, students earning these scores or higher on MAP are projected to pass PARCC
- Currently (Winter) 1 EL student (ID 7068) scored high enough on both sections
- Minimum spring score to predict passing PARCC:  

| Grade | ELA MAP Score | Math MAP Score |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| 6th grade | 214 | 223 |
| 7th grade | 219 | 227 |
| 8th grade | 222 | 235 |


## Findings
- Generally, a correlation, but validity of data is undermined by **high** disengagement 
- The vast majority of students with 0.0 GPA (except 2) were disengaged on the test. If students are failing all their classes, they have not mastered the material and will also be unable to answer the questions on the MAP test. Seeing a number of questions students cannot answer leads low self-efficacy which in turn leads to rapid guessing
- Disengagement significantly more prevalent on the ELA test. Language learners may find more significant challenges on ELA test so higher disengagement makes
- Disengagement and multiple Fs was most prevalent in grades with most teacher turnover & highest number of WIDA 1s & 2s (7th & 9th)
   - However, there were differences between these grades:
      - 7th grade ELLs and non-ELLs were disengaged at similar rates
      - 9th grade ELLs were 2-3x less engaged than their non-ELL peers
   - We can’t do anything about turnover that has already happened or # of ELs, how to support these grades? Research has shown detrimental effect of mid-year teacher turnover 


## Discussion Questions
- Did you notice other trends? 
- Are there insights or inferences you’d like to share?
- What could be productive next steps?


## Next Steps
- Work to determine the source of disengagement:
   - Unable to do work with current supports? Missing prerequisite knowledge? Mental health?
   - Can we determine what is causing differences among grades (ex: 8th vs. 9th)? 
- Ensure ELLs are receiving consistent, research-based accommodations so they can engage as fully as possible in classroom instruction regardless of English proficiency
- Reevaluate accommodations for students not growing and consider more intensive language instruction
- Collaborate to make plans for chronically disengaged and failing students
- Discuss with students before future tests why the data is important
